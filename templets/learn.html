			<br> 
		<p style="font-family: Montserrat;color: black;font-size: 18px;">
			The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold. Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces that operate under a defined set of regulations. 
			Stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares and other eligible financial instruments with confidence, with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the defined rules as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as primary markets and secondary markets.
			<h4 style="color:#021B79;">WHAT IS A STOCK?</h4>
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: Montserrat;color: black;font-size: 18px;">
			A stock is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company or corporation and a proportionate claim on its assets and earnings. Stocks are also called shares or equity.
			Traders on the stock market include market makers, investors, traders, speculators, and hedgers. An investor may buy stocks and hold them for the long term, while a trader may enter and exit a position within seconds. A market maker provides necessary liquidity in the market, while a hedger may trade in derivatives.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: Montserrat;color: black;font-size: 18px;">
			<h4 style="color: #021B79;">HOW DO YOU BUY OR SELL A STOCK?</h4>
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: Montserrat;color: black;font-size: 18px;">
			You can buy or sell stock on your own by opening a brokerage account with one of the many brokerage firms. After opening your account, connect it with your bank checking account to make deposits, which are then available for you to invest in.
However, do not equate the ease of opening an account with the ease of making good investment decisions.<br><br> It is generally recommended that beginners speak to a qualified financial advisor. New investors might benefit from reading the key book The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham. Smart investing can be highly satisfying, so take it slow, do your research, and seek out a broker that suits your interests and goals.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: Montserrat;color: black;font-size: 18px;">
			Have you ever wondered, How the share prices are set? Here's how it is done.
<br>The prices of shares on a stock market can be set in several ways. The most common way is through an auction process where buyers and sellers place bids and offer to buy or sell. A bid is a price at which somebody wishes to buy, and an offer, or ask, is the price at which somebody wishes to sell. When the bid and ask coincide, a trade is made.
		</p>
			<h4 style="color:#021B79;">WHAT IS A STOCK SIMULATOR?</h4>
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: Montserrat;color: black;font-size: 18px;">
			
			A stock simulator is more of a software or computer program designed to mirror the actual stock markets but without the involvement of real money. The features and user interface of a stock market simulator is similar to any real trading platform. The purpose of these simulators is that they help new investors to enhance their understanding of stock picking. It’s basically meant for the practice (using virtual money) of investing in stock markets.</p> 
			<h4 style="color:#021B79;">WHY STOCK SIMULATOR?<h4>
		<p style="font-family: Montserrat;color: black;font-size: 18px;">
					Do you know that, there has been an unprecedented rise in the number of new Demat accounts that were opened in India after the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic. For novice investors with little to no experience of investing might face some problems when they start investing their hard-earned money into the stock market. <br><br> Thus, it is advised by many veteran investors to first get some exposure to investing via a stock market simulator. It will provide a great learning experience to novice investors.</p>
